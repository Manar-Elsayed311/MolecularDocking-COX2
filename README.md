## Project Overview

This project presents a molecular docking analysis of two compounds against human and mouse cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) structures.

The workflow includes:
- Protein preparation and ligand optimization  
- Docking simulations using **AutoDock Vina**  
- Binding site visualization with **PyMOL** and **Discovery Studio**  
- ADMET analysis for selected compounds  
- Gene enrichment analysis for shared COX-2–related genes in humans and mice

## Tools and Software

- **AutoDock Vina** – docking simulations  
- **PyMOL** – binding site visualization  
- **Discovery Studio** – interaction analysis  
- **SwissADME** – pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness  
- **STRING** and **Venny 2.1** – shared gene identification and enrichment analysis
