Molecular Docking Analysis of COX-2
Project Overview

This project presents a molecular docking analysis of two compounds against human and mouse cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) structures.

The workflow includes:

Protein preparation and ligand optimization

Docking simulations using AutoDock Vina

Binding site visualization with PyMOL and Discovery Studio

ADMET analysis for selected compounds

Gene enrichment analysis for shared COX-2–related genes in humans and mice

Tools and Software

AutoDock Vina – docking simulations

PyMOL – binding site visualization

Discovery Studio – interaction analysis

SwissADME – pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness

STRING and Venny 2.1 – shared gene identification and enrichment analysis

Results Summary

Both compounds showed strong binding affinities with human and mouse COX-2.

Distinct differences in binding patterns were observed between species.

ADMET analysis confirmed good drug-likeness for the tested compounds.

Gene enrichment revealed shared pathways between human and mouse COX-2.
